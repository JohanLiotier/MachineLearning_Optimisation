Optimisation program based on DoE and SVR

Here is grouped the optimisation program and files used in the paper. 
The program is described in Program.py with a small procedure at the end.
The two Jupyter Notebooks give the obtained results with the experiments of the different optimisation rounds for the TEMPO and Iodine electrolytes. 
The utilised data are displayed in the different .csv files.
